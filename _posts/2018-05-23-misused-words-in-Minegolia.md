title: Correction Proposal For 6 Misused Words In Minegolia
date: 2018-05-23
---

I speak native Mongolian and write in vertical Mongolian script. Also, I have basic knowledge of Cyrillic Mongolian. 

Here I would like to propose native replacements for a few misused or improper Mongolian words, as in the following picture.

I also recoreded my speaking of the picture, please check out the below video:

  frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

I wish my proposal could reach to the attention of Minegolian linguists, dictionary compilers, textbook writers as well as paper and online editors,etc. to hopefully see them corrected in near future.

Hope Mongolian language could survive globalization and digitization.
