Lake Hugsgul(ᠬᠦᠭᠰᠦᠭᠦᠯ) is a famous tour spot of Mongolia.
But majority of people say it wrongly as Hubsgul(ᠬᠦᠪᠰᠦᠭᠦᠯ).

The original meaning of the lake's name has to do with 'хөг(ᠬᠦᠭ)' which means 'tunes, melody or music', but not to do with 'puffiness' or 'fluffiness'.
See the explanation below given by renowned scholar C.Galsan.
