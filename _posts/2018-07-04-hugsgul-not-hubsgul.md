Lake **Hugsgul(ᠬᠦᠭᠰᠦᠭᠦᠯ)** is a famous tour spot of Mongolia.
But majority of people say it wrongly as _**Hubsgul(ᠬᠦᠪᠰᠦᠭᠦᠯ)**_.

The original meaning of the lake's name has to do with '**хөг(ᠬᠦᠭ)**' which means 'tunes, melody or music', but _**NOT to do with 'puffiness' or 'fluffiness'**_.
See the explanation below given by renowned scholar, linguist and master of Russian language(Pushkin Gold Medalist) S.Galsan (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXvxtKie40Y&t=29m39s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXvxtKie40Y&t=29m39s</a>).
