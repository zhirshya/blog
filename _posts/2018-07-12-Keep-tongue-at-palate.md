**keywords**: Orthotropics, tongue, palate, retruded jaw, mandible, cranial distortion, midline discrepancy, displaced dental midline, facial asymmetry.


I have significant overbite and displaced dental midline, which have caused me slight facial asymmetry.
I have to train myself for:
<ul>
**<li>lips closed together</li>**
**<li>upper and lower teeth aligned and gently touching</li>**
**<li>tongue pushing against palate</li>**
**<li>NOT sucking teeth while swallowing</li>**
**<li>breathing through nose</li>**
</ul>

Check out following videos presented by Professor John Mew and Dr. Mike Mew (father and son).
