title: Keep Tongue at Palate!
date: 2018-07-12

**keywords**: Orthotropics, tongue, palate, retruded jaw, mandible, cranial distortion, midline discrepancy, displaced dental midline, facial asymmetry.


I have significant overbite and displaced dental midline, which have caused me slight facial asymmetry.

I have to train myself for:
<ul>
<li><b>lips closed together</b></li>
<li><b>upper and lower teeth aligned and gently touching</b></li>
<li><b>tongue pushing against palate</b></li>
<li><b>NOT sucking teeth while swallowing</b></li>
<li><b>breathing through nose</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm unable to keep **upper and lower teeth aligned and gently touching** and **tongue pushing against palate** during sleep.
Registering them in subconscious mind could be the only way to make them correct during sleep?

Check out following videos presented by Professor John Mew and Dr. Mike Mew (father and son).
