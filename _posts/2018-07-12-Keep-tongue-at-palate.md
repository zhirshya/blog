**keywords**: Orthotropics, tongue, palate, retruded jaw, mandible, cranial distortion, midline discrepancy, displaced dental midline, facial asymmetry.


I have significant overbite and displaced dental midline, which have caused me slight facial asymmetry.
I have to train myself for:
<ol>
**<ul>ulps closed together</ul>**
**<ul>upper and lower teeth aulgned and gently touching</ul>**
**<ul>tongue pushing against palate</ul>**
**<ul>NOT sucking teeth while swallowing</ul>**
**<ul>breathing through nose</ul>**
</ol>

Check out following videos presented by Professor John Mew and Dr. Mike Mew (father and son).
