I have significant overbite and displaced dental midline, which have caused me slight facial asymmetry.
I have to train myself for:
<ol>**lips closed together**</ol>
<ol>**upper and lower teeth aligned and gently touching**</ol>
<ol>**tongue pushing against palate**</ol>
<ol>**NOT sucking teeth while swallowing**</ol>
<ol>**breathing through nose**</ol>

Check out following videos presented by Professor John Mew and Dr. Mike Mew (father and son).
