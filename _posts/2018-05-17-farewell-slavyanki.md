I've wasted countless time watching TV and online dramas, movies, MTV, etc.
Certainly I had hypnotized by Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Western soap operas, movies and TV shows until recently.

Life is not always fun and joy, more realistically as Brian Tracy said, life is repetition of problems and crises.
Soap operas and most of TV shows are nothing more than illusions.

19th and 20th century Russian songs, especially **Прощание славянки (Farewell of Slavianka)** always give me spiritual strength to carry on living on my own.

Russian is a beautiful language.
