title: A Problem of Bainu App for Android ?
date: 2018-07-11

Bainu is a traditional Mongolian app for socialization, which has been developed by Zuga tech, Hohhot.
Though I heard about it more than a year ago, I signed up with it at the end of this June.
It somehow feels like tinder, which I have never used, ever.

I'm not photogenic at all. I just wanted to give it a try, maybe I could meet a woman who knows traditional Mongolian and hopefully also gets interested in befriending with me.

So I posted some notes by using its built-in keyboard. One problem baffles me since the last use is how to write(input) the 6th and 7th Mongolian vowels in Bainu.
Whether using Shift with u, u followed with e or o followed with e don't make it.

I wrote this question using Delehi IME and AronWriter on Windows, as below.

<div>
    <img src="{{ "/images/6th-7th-vowel-Bainu.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="How to input 6th and 7th Mongolian vowels in Bainu" style="width:50%;" >
</div>

Since I don't have iPhone, I don't know if its iOS counterpart has similar problem or not.
