Majority of Bargu(**ᠪᠠᠷᠭᠣ**) people in Hulunbuir have preserved well our Mongolian language and culture until around 1960.
Since then, the massive excessive Han immigration completely outnumbered us the indigenous people, and the assimilation induced gradual loss and impurification of our language and culture.

We do use until today a few **interesting native words** which have been abandoned for long time or have never ever been used by other Mongols.
For example, **ᠰᠣᠨᠢᠭᠣᠬᠠᠨ(rare and delightful)**᠂**ᠭᠦᠦᠷᠡᠬᠦ(understand, grok)**᠂**ᠪᠢᠰᠢᠭᠦᠷᠬᠡᠬᠦ(_Vi._ shy away)**᠂**ᠣᠢᠲᠣᠭ (that thing, animal or human near the listener)**᠂**ᠮᠣᠨᠲᠣᠷᠬᠠᠢ (_adj._ round)**᠂**ᠦᠲᠦᠭ ᠡ ("ᠦᠲᠦᠭ" means "dung"; + exclamation "ᠡ " means "Oh shit(surprised)"**᠂**ᠯᠠᠮᠠ ᠠ (equivalent of "Oh my God")**᠂**ᠪᠣᠷᠬᠠᠨ ᠠ (equivalent of "Oh my God")**,_**ᠪᠦᠦᠷᠬᠡ(pronounced "бүүрэх" and means "leather boot"?(I'm not certain))**_, etc.
